# IPROCESSxyz Viewport Animation

This project contains a collection of interactive JavaScript animations ("pens") designed for the IProcess website viewport.

## Features

-   **Multiple Animation Styles:** Includes various particle effects, confetti, and interactive elements.
-   **Dynamic Loading:** Scripts for dependencies are loaded dynamically as needed.
-   **Randomized Selection:** A random animation is selected and displayed on each load (or via specific logic).
-   **User Interaction:** Many pens respond to mouse movements, clicks, and collisions.

## Pens Included

1.  **tsParticles:** Particle network.
2.  **particleVector:** Vector-based particle system.
3.  **fireworks:** Fireworks animation.
4.  **threeConfetti:** 3D confetti using Three.js.
5.  **simpleParticles:** Basic particle system.
6.  **pointerParticles:** Particles generated by pointer interaction.
7.  **bubbles:** Bubble-like particles.
8.  **connectedParticles:** Particles that connect with lines when close.
9.  **holdParticles:** Particles generated on click/hold.

## Usage

Include `IPROCESSxyz-viewport-animation.js` in your project. It is designed to work with a specific HTML structure (e.g., an element with id `intro-stage`).

## Dependencies

Some animations rely on external libraries like:
-   `tsParticles`
-   `Three.js`
-   `dat.gui`
-   `stats.js`

These are loaded dynamically by the main script.
